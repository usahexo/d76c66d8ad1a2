      		<h1 id="Milan-Fails-To-Close-Gap-On-Juventus-After-Losing-To-Sassuolo"><a href="#Milan-Fails-To-Close-Gap-On-Juventus-After-Losing-To-Sassuolo" class="headerlink" title="Milan Fails To Close Gap On Juventus After Losing To Sassuolo"></a>Milan Fails To Close Gap On Juventus After Losing To Sassuolo</h1><p>Saturday’s clash between Sassuolo and Milan at the MAPEI Stadium ended in a disappointing 2-0 loss for the visitors, who were unable to close the gap on league leaders Juventus.</p>
<p>Domenico Berardi opened the scoring for Sassuolo in the 13th minute after converting from the penalty spot, following a handball from Milan defender Ricardo Rodriguez. The Argentine doubled his team’s lead 10 minutes later with a powerful volley into the top corner, leaving goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with no chance.</p>
<p>Milan had a number of chances to get back into the game in the second half, but failed to make the most of them. Patrick Cutrone hit the woodwork twice in quick succession, while substitute Suso also saw a shot saved by Sassuolo goalkeeper Andrea Consigli. Jakub Jankto also squandered an opportunity to score his first goal for Sassuolo when he was sent through on goal in injury time, but his attempt was thwarted by Donnarumma.</p>
<p>The result leaves Milan in fourth place in Serie A, six points behind Juventus and four points ahead of fifth-place Roma. Next up for Gennaro Gattuso’s side is a trip to face Chievo Verona at the Stadio Marc’Angelo Ventura on February 24.</p>
<h1 id="Higuain-Nets-Twice-As-Napoli-Overcome-10-Man-Chievo"><a href="#Higuain-Nets-Twice-As-Napoli-Overcome-10-Man-Chievo" class="headerlink" title="Higuain Nets Twice As Napoli Overcome 10-Man Chievo"></a>Higuain Nets Twice As Napoli Overcome 10-Man Chievo</h1><p>Gonzalo Higuain netted twice and set up Marek Hamsik as 10-man Napoli came from behind to beat Chievo 3-1 and maintain their 100 percent record in Serie A on Sunday.</p>
<p>Valter Birsa had put the Flying Donkeys ahead early on, but Higuain levelled shortly before the break and then notched his sixth goal of the season with a clever finish after being played in by Hamsik.</p>
<p>Jose Callejon thought he had made it four for Napoli when he slotted home late on, but his goal was ruled out for offside.</p>
<p>Andrea stations outsider accepted that a rebound from Gigi Buffon career struck his arm during stoppage time to hand victory to Antonio Conte’s side.Napoli have not tasted defeat given that their opening day loss at Atalanta and are now two points behind Juventus – who they visit next week – following the Bianconeri’s 3-2 conquer of Lazio on Saturday.Higuain has now scored in each of his last three league matches while Napoli as a group have found the net 11 conditions this season.Elsewhere, Roma bounced straight back from their derby humiliation against Lazio last weekend by hammering promoted Spal 4-0 away. Diego Perotti, Stephan El Shaarawy, Edin Dzeko and Kevin Strootman got the goals for Eusebio Di Francesco’s side, who climb to fourth place.Benevento recorded their first top-flight point thanks to a goalless draw at Udinese, while Verona registered their maiden win courtesy of Emil Hallfredsson’s solitary strike against Crotone.”Today we could’ve done better with our finishing,” said Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri.”But I liked how we reacted after going behind and the way we were able to take control of the game.”</p>
<p>Birsa had given Chievo a fifth-minute lead when he collected Fabrizio Cacciatore’s through ball before firing past Pepe Reina, but Higuain soon restored parity by heading home Jorginho’s cross.Hamsik then set up Higuain for his second of the match shortly before the hour mark, and Callejon thought he had made it four when he found the net late on, only for his celebrations to be cut short by an offside flag.There was still time for drama in stoppage time as Buffon saved from Dries Mertens but only succeeded in pushing the ball into the path of Andrea Conti, who saw his effort crash against the post before bouncing off Birsa’s arm and into the net.”It was definitely not intentional,” admitted Birsa.”I am very happy with my goal but also with the team’s performance. We didn’t give anything away defensively and created some good chances too.”</p>
<h1 id="Roma-Held-At-Home-By-Struggling-Spal"><a href="#Roma-Held-At-Home-By-Struggling-Spal" class="headerlink" title="Roma Held At Home By Struggling Spal"></a>Roma Held At Home By Struggling Spal</h1><p>Roma suffered a shock home defeat at the hands of struggling SPAL on Saturday, as they fell to a 2-1 reverse. It was Keita Balde’s 82nd minute strike that won it for the visitors, who had gone behind to Stephan El Shaarawy’s opener.</p>
<p>The result leaves Roma in fourth place in Serie A, four points adrift of leaders Napoli. SPAL, meanwhile, move off the bottom of the table courtesy of their first win in 10 games.</p>
<p>Roma made a bright start and took the lead midway through the first half. Keita Balde was brought down by goalkeeper Mirco Vicario and El Shaarawy dispatched the resulting penalty into the bottom corner.</p>
<p>However, SPAL fought back after the interval and equalised through Marco Borriello’s header. The hosts looked like they would hold on for victory but Balde had other ideas, firing past Alisson Becker late on to clinch all three points for his side.</p>
<h1 id="Lazio-Continue-Their-Fine-Run-With-A-Dominant-Win-Over-Udinese"><a href="#Lazio-Continue-Their-Fine-Run-With-A-Dominant-Win-Over-Udinese" class="headerlink" title="Lazio Continue Their Fine Run With A Dominant Win Over Udinese"></a>Lazio Continue Their Fine Run With A Dominant Win Over Udinese</h1><p>The Biancocelesti welcomed Udinese to the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday looking to extend their unbeaten run in Serie A to six matches. They comfortably achieved this, with a 3-0 victory that saw all three goals scored in the first half. This result sees them move up to fourth place in the table, just two points behind Napoli in third.</p>
<p>Lazio started brightly and were rewarded for their early pressure with the opening goal in the eleventh minute. Luis Alberto’s low drive from distance found its way through a crowded penalty area and nestled into the bottom corner of the net. The home side continued to dominate proceedings and doubled their lead in the thirty-second minute. A brilliant team move ended with Joaquin Correa’s precise finish from close range.</p>
<p>Udinese came closest to reducing the deficit before halftime, but Samir Handanovic produced a fine save to keep out Ignacio Widmer’s header. However, there was no stopping Lazio in the forty-sixth minute as they added their third goal of the match. Ciro Immobile finished well after being played through by Correa, securing an important three points for Simone Inzaghi’s side.</p>
<p>This was an excellent team performance from Lazio, who continue their fine form heading into the busy festive period. They now face a difficult trip to Turin next weekend to take on Juventus, but will be confident of getting a result against one of Italy’s top sides.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-End-Seven-Match-Winless-Streak-With-Hard-Fought-Victory-Over-Torino"><a href="#Inter-End-Seven-Match-Winless-Streak-With-Hard-Fought-Victory-Over-Torino" class="headerlink" title="Inter End Seven-Match Winless Streak With Hard-Fought Victory Over Torino"></a>Inter End Seven-Match Winless Streak With Hard-Fought Victory Over Torino</h1><p>Manchester City finally put an end to their winless run in all competitions extended to seven matches with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Torino at the Etihad Stadium. The Citizens took the lead in the first half through Leroy Sane, but they were made to work hard for the three points by a resolute Torino side who refused to give up.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s men continued to labour in front of goal in the second half, but Raheem Sterling finally broke the deadlock with a close-range finish with just a few minutes remaining on the clock. That goal finally sealed all three points for Manchester City and moved them up to second place in the Premier League table, just two points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p>Guardiola made a number of changes to his starting line-up for this game, with Aymeric Laporte, Fernandinho and David Silva coming into the team in place of Vincent Kompany, John Stones and Ilkay Gundogan. There was also a start for Sane after he had been left out of the team for Manchester City’s last two games.</p>
<p>The home side started brightly and took the lead in the 15th minute through Sane. The German international received a pass from Sterling on the edge of the penalty area before firing an excellent right-footed shot past Torino goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu into the top corner of the net.</p>
<p>Torino responded well to going behind and they came close to equalising shortly afterwards when Andrea Belotti’s header was superbly saved by Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson. The visitors continued to pressurize Manchester City throughout the first half, but they were unable to find an equalizer before halftime.</p>
<p>The second half began much like the first had ended, with Torino on top and looking dangerous going forward. However, as time wore on Manchester City started to gain control of proceedings and they eventually doubled their lead through Sterling in stoppage time.</p>
<p>The England international received a pass from Gabriel Jesus inside the penalty area before slotting home a right-footed shot into the bottom corner of the net. That goal finally sealed all three points for Manchester City and moved them up to second place in the Premier League table, just two points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
