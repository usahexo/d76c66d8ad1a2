#  Broncos Win Super Bowl, But Bettors Lose Money

The Denver Broncos became the Super Bowl 50 champions after they defeated the Carolina Panthers, 24-10. Bettors who wagered on the Broncos however, did not come out as victorious. In fact, bettors who wagered on the Broncos lost approximately $15 million, according to sports analytics firm Eilers Research.

The favored Broncos were able to cover the -3 point spread and won the game outright, but most bettors who wagered on them did not get as lucky. The Panthers were an underdog at +3.5 points and a majority of people who bet on them were hoping for an upset victory.

This is not the first time that bettors have lost money when wagering on the Super Bowl. In fact, over the last six years, bettors have lost more than $100 million when betting on the Super Bowl. The New England Patriots’ victory in this year’s game was no exception, with bettors losing $5 million when they wagered on the Patriots. This is likely due to the fact that NFL games are relatively unpredictable and offer relatively low odds when pitted against other sports like basketball or baseball.

#  Bettors Hit Hard By Broncos' Super Bowl Loss

It would be an understatement to say that the Denver Broncos' loss in Super Bowl 50 was a disappointment for their fans and bettors. The Broncos were a three-point favorite going into the game, but they were crushed by the Carolina Panthers, who won by a score of 24-10.

This was a particularly tough loss for bettors because there was so much money at stake. Precise data on how much money was wagered on the Super Bowl is not available, but experts estimate that it was in the billions of dollars. And since the Broncos lost, those who bet on them are left with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

For example, one sports book in Las Vegas took in more than $15 million in bets on the Broncos, and nearly all of those bets were losers. In other words, the sports book made more than $15 million on bets against the Broncos - a damning indictment of just how badly they played on Sunday night.

The bad news for bettors does not stop there, though. Not only did the Broncos lose, but they also failed to cover the point spread. This means that anyone who bet on them was not only wrong about which team would win, but they also lost money simply because of the margin of victory.

So while some people may have won money by betting on Carolina, it is clear that most people lost big time thanks to this game. In fact, one industry insider has estimated that 80% of all money wagered on the Super Bowl was lost by bettors - and that number is likely to grow as we get closer to tax day.

This debacle will no doubt lead to some soul searching by bettors across the country. How could they have been so wrong about one of the biggest games of the year? And where do they go from here?

These are tough questions to answer, but it is clear that bettors need to take a long hard look at themselves if they hope to avoid similar fiascos in future. Sports betting can be a fun hobby or pastime, but it can also be very risky - especially when there is so much money at stake.

#  Sports Betting Payouts Fail To Favor Broncos In Super Bowl

Denver may have been victorious in the Super Bowl, but when it comes to betting payouts, Broncos fans didn't come out on top. Nevada sportsbooks paid out $132.5 million on bets for the game, with 58 percent of that going to those who bet on the Seattle Seahawks.

Despite being underdogs coming into the game, Seattle actually had slightly better odds of winning than Denver did. The Broncos were given a -2.5 point advantage by most sportsbooks, meaning that a successful wager would have returned nearly three times the amount wagered had Denver pulled off the upset.

This is not uncommon for big games like the Super Bowl. Bettors tend to put their money on the favorite, resulting in lower payouts for those who back the underdog. In fact, this year's game marks the sixth time in seven years that the team with better odds has failed to win outright.

So next year when you're placing your bets, be sure to give underdog teams a closer look. You may not make as much money as if you'd placed a bet on the favorite, but at least you'll have a better chance of seeing some return on your investment.

#  Denver Broncos Fall Short In Super Bowl, But Bettors Cash Out Big 

The Denver Broncos were defeated by the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, but that didn't stop many from winning big betting on the game. According to reports, the amount of money wagered on the game was some $132 million, with nearly 80% of that being put down on the Broncos. 

Despite the loss, sports books in Nevada still profited from the game thanks to a number of large bets placed on the Panthers. The biggest single bet on the game was a $6.5 million wager placed on Carolina by an unidentified gambler. 

While most people who bet on the Super Bowl lost out this year, there were a few lucky ones. A Nevada man who bet $20 on Carolina at odds of +550 walked away with a $1,100 payout.

# Super Bowl XLVIII: How Sports Betting Payouts Work

The Super Bowl is a national American tradition. Millions of viewers tune in to the big game every year to watch their favorite teams play for the championship title.

While some people watch for the love of the sport, others are there for another reason – to place bets and hopefully earn some money. If you’re new to sports betting, here’s what you need to know about Super Bowl payouts:

How do Super Bowl payouts work?

When you bet on the Super Bowl, you’re essentially predicting which team will win the game. There are a variety of different bets you can make, including bets on individual players or on the outcome of specific matchups.

The payout for each type of bet varies depending on how likely it is to win. For example, a bet on the team that is favored to win will typically pay out less than a bet on the underdog.

How do I collect my payout?

If you win your bet, you will either receive your payout as cash or as a Ticket In-Running (TIR), which allows you to leave your bet open until the end of the game. TIRs allow you to cash in on better odds, but they also come with more risk.

What are the different types of Super Bowl payouts?

There are three main types of Super Bowl payouts: straight bets, parlays, and teasers. Straight bets are simple wagers placed on one team winning the game. Parlays involve betting on two or more teams, and each team must win for you to collect your payout. Teasers are similar to parlays, but they give you slightly better odds in exchange for making it more difficult to win your bet.
