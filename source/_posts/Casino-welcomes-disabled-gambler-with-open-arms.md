#  Casino welcomes disabled gambler with open arms

Casino executives are applauding new measures by the industry’s regulatory body that will make it easier for disabled people to gamble.

A new set of guidelines released this week by the National Gambling Board (NGB) will make it compulsory for casinos to provide wheelchair access, sign language interpreters and other amenities that will make the gambling experience more enjoyable for those with disabilities.

The casino industry has welcomed the move, with many executives saying they have been waiting for years for such guidelines.

“We’ve always been open to welcoming people with disabilities, and we already provide a number of special amenities for them,” said a spokesperson for casino group Sun International.

“But these new guidelines will help us do even more, and we’re really happy about that. We hope to see more disabled people come and enjoy our casinos in the future.”

The NGB says the new measures are necessary in order to ensure that all South Africans can enjoy gambling in a safe and comfortable environment.

#  Disabled man's fun night at the casino

Last night, my good friend John and I went to the casino for some fun. John is a disabled man, so we were excited to see if the casino offered any type of accommodation for disabled guests.

As it turned out, the casino was fully wheelchair accessible! This was great news for John, as he is unable to stand for long periods of time. The staff at the casino were also very helpful and friendly, always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that our visit was enjoyable.

We started our night by hitting the slot machines. John is a big fan of slots, so he was in his element! We each put a few dollars in and started playing. I have to say, I'm not the best at slots, but I had a lot of fun trying my luck.

After a while, we decided to try our hand at some of the table games. We played blackjack and roulette, and even though we didn't win anything big, we had a lot of laughs trying.

All in all, it was a great night at the casino! If you're looking for a fun night out that's also wheelchair accessible, I would definitely recommend giving the casino a try.

#  Casino makes game more accessible for disabled players

According to a report from the National Council on Disability, less than 20% of public accommodations are accessible to people with disabilities. This leaves out a significant chunk of the population, as one in five Americans reports having a disability.

In response to this gap in accessibility, some businesses and organizations have chosen to become more inclusive. One such business is the casino industry.

Casinos are now making their games more accessible to players with disabilities. This includes offering wheelchairs services, Braille menus, and even sign language interpreters.

This change has come about due to several lawsuits filed by disabled players against casinos. These lawsuits have helped to reshape the industry and make it more accommodating for all players.

The progress made by casinos is admirable, and other businesses could learn from their example. By becoming more inclusive, businesses can help to level the playing field for those who have been left out in the past.

#  Casino ensures disabled gambler has a good time

The casino industry is under close scrutiny for a few reasons: their contribution to problem gambling and propensity for money laundering, for example. However, there are some good stories to tell about the casinos as well, and this is one of them.

When you think of casinos, chances are you don’t think of people with disabilities. But that’s exactly who they’re thinking of at the Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The casino offers a special gaming experience tailored specifically for disabled guests.

The design of the special area is meant to be barrier-free, with lowered betting tables and chairs fitted with waist-high rests. There’s also a private lounge where guests can relax between games.

It’s not just the physical accommodations that make this area special; it’s the staff too. All of the employees working in the area have been trained in disability etiquette so they can provide a welcoming and comfortable experience for all guests.

Marcy Carsey is a regular at the disabled gaming area at Parx Casino. She has multiple sclerosis and finds it difficult to get around conventional casinos. “I come here because I feel like everyone is treated equal no matter what your disability is,” she said. “The staff are so nice and willing to help out in any way possible, which makes my experience a lot more enjoyable.”

Dawn Butler, who heads up Pennsylvania’s Disability Rights Office, agrees that Parx Casino sets the standard for how disabled gamblers should be treated. “They go above and beyond in terms of making sure that everybody has an opportunity to participate in the same kinds of activities as everyone else, regardless of their abilities or disabilities,” she said.

Other casinos could certainly learn from Parx Casino when it comes to accommodating guests with disabilities. In an industry that sometimes struggles to shake its negative reputation, this is one story that deserves to be told more often.

#  Disabled gambler enjoys evening at casino

When most people think of a casino, they imagine lively crowds of people gambling and having a good time. But for one disabled gambler, a recent evening at the casino provided a much-needed respite from the boredom and isolation of life at home.

The gambler, who lives with a disability that limits his mobility, spent hours watching others gamble and chatting with the other guests in the casino. He said he especially enjoyed the camaraderie of the other guests and the excitement of the games.

"It was great to get out and be around other people," he said. "I don't get to do that very often since I'm not able to get around very easily."

He also credited the casino staff with being warm and welcoming, noting that they went out of their way to ensure he had a good time.

"The staff was amazing," he said. "They were so helpful and accommodating. I really appreciate it."

While he didn't win any money on this particular visit, the gambler said he was still happy to have had the opportunity to enjoy an evening at the casino.
