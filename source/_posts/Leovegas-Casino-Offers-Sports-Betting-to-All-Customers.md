#  Leovegas Casino Welcomes New Sport to its Betting Markets

 Leovegas Casino, one of the world's leading online casinos, has announced the addition of a new sport to its betting markets. The sport in question is rugby union, and punters can now bet on fixtures from the Rugby Union International fixture list.

Leovegas Casino has been quick to start offering markets for the upcoming Autumn Internationals, with odds available for all of the matches taking place between 3rd and 25th November. New Zealand are unsurprisingly favourites to win the tournament, with England and Ireland both considered close contenders.

For those not familiar with rugby union, it is a contact sport that is played by two teams of fifteen players. The aim of the game is to score more points than the opposing team by carrying or kicking the ball over the opponent's try line. There are several ways to achieve this, including grounding the ball in-goal (similar to a touchdown in American football), scoring a penalty goal or drop goal, or running the ball into the end zone.

If you're looking to get in on some Autumn Internationals betting action, be sure to check out Leovegas Casino's website for all of the latest odds. And who knows - you might just be lucky enough to pick up some winner's dividends!
