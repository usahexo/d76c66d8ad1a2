#  MGM National Harbor Goes Online With New Casino

The $1.4 billion MGM National Harbor casino resort has gone online in Prince George's County, Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C.

MGM National Harbor is the latest in a series of massive casino resorts to go online in the past few years. The Growth of the casino industry in the US can be largely attributed to the legalization of gaming in some states, starting with Nevada in 1931. In recent years, more states have turned to gambling as a way to generate revenue and create jobs.

Today there are nearly 1,000 casinos in the US, with annual gross revenues totaling more than $80 billion. The industry employs over half a million people and has helped revive or create communities across the country.

The biggest beneficiary of the casino boom has been Las Vegas, which now attracts 43 million visitors a year. But other parts of the country are seeing benefits too. Atlantic City has seen its fortunes turn around following the legalization of online gaming in New Jersey.

In Pennsylvania, where casinos have been legal since 2004, gaming revenues have grown from $769 million that year to over $3 billion last year. These revenues have helped fund social programs and education initiatives in the state.

Gambling is an important part of US culture and has generated billions of dollars for states and local communities across the country. With MGM National Harbor going online today, that trend looks set to continue for many years to come.
