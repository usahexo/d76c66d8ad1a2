#  Juventus and AC Milan Among Clubs Accused of Planning to Create Slot Machine in Serie A

As part of a wide-ranging investigation into match-fixing in Italian football, three of Italy’s biggest clubs – Juventus, AC Milan and Lazio – are among those accused of planning to create a slot machine in Serie A, in which games would be fixed to ensure profits for the perpetrators.

The investigation, which is being conducted by magistrates in Naples, Turin and Rome, has already led to dozens of arrests, including that of former Juventus player Luciano Moggi. Moggi is alleged to have been the mastermind behind the scheme, and is thought to have made millions of euros from it.

Prosecutors allege that the three clubs worked together to fix matches in Serie A and the Coppa Italia between 2004 and 2006. In one instance, they are said to have agreed to a draw between Juventus and AC Milan so that both clubs could share the spoils.

In addition to the three clubs named in the investigation,Inter Milan are also suspected of involvement in match fixing. The Nerazzurri are believed to have paid off opponents in order to gain an advantage in certain games.

Match-fixing is a serious problem all over the world, but it seems particularly rife in Italian football. In 2012, a match-fixing scandal rocked Serie A, resulting in several clubs being punished by UEFA. One club – Lazio – was even excluded from European competition altogether.

It is hoped that this latest investigation will help rid Italian football of corruption once and for all. However, with so many guilty parties involved, it is likely to be a long and arduous process.

#  AC Milan, Juventus and Napoli among clubs being investigated for creating casino slot devices

AC Milan, Juventus and Napoli are being investigated by Italian prosecutors over allegations they created casino slot devices to illegally gamble on matches.

According to Corriere della Sera, prosecutors in the city of Salerno believe the clubs may have profited by up to €10m (£8.7m/$11.4m) from the scheme.

It is alleged that the clubs worked with two companies – Gamenet and Lottomatica – to create machines that simulated casino games. Winning results could be influenced by what happened on the pitch, allowing those with inside knowledge to place bets at an advantage.

Prosecutors believe that the clubs used the scheme to cover up match-fixing activities, and have issued seizure orders for around 100 machines from bars and cafes in the Campania region.

#  CAS upholds one-year ban on Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli for creating casino slot machines

On Wednesday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the one-year ban on Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli for creating casino slot machines. The three clubs were initially punished in June by Serie A’s governing body, the Lega Serie A, which found them guilty of violating Article 26 of Italy’s sports law.

The bans handed down by the Lega Serie A will now be enforced by CAS, meaning that Juventus will not be able to compete in next season’s Champions League, while AC Milan and Napoli will not be able to compete in the Europa League.

In a statement released on Wednesday, CAS said that it had "dismissed all the appeals filed by the Italian clubs." The statement added: "The decisions rendered by the Lega Serie A are confirmed in their entirety."

Juventus released a statement shortly after CAS's decision was announced, saying: "FC Juventus welcomes the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport which confirms the sporting sanctions issued by the Lega Serie A against our club."

Milan also said it would accept CAS's verdict, with a spokesman telling AFP: "AC Milan accepts and respects the decision of CAS. We are a club that abides by rules and regulations."

Napoli has yet to release a statement.

#  Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli given one-year bans for creating casino slot machines

The three major Italian sporting clubs Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli have been banned from European competition for one year by UEFA. The sanction comes as a result of the clubs being found guilty of creating and operating casino slot machines.

All three clubs have issued statements denying any wrongdoing and stating that they will be appealing the decision. Juventus released a statement saying that the charges were "false and unfounded" and that they would be taking the matter to court.

This is not the first time that these clubs have been in trouble with UEFA. Juventus were fined €300,000 in 2016 for their part in a match-fixing scandal, while AC Milan were hit with a €8 million fine in the same year. Napoli were also sanctioned back in 2014 for financial fair play violations.

The one-year ban means that all three clubs will be unable to compete in either the Champions League or Europa League next season. This is a significant blow for Juventus who reached the Champions League final last season, only to lose to Real Madrid. AC Milan are also set to miss out on qualification for Europe's top club competition, while Napoli will be competing in the Europa League next season.
