#  Trump Tower is not a new casino free slot machines for one simple reason – Donald Trump!

The building is actually one of Trump's early successes in the world of real estate. He first unveiled the plans for the tower in 1979 and it was completed in 1983. That's more than 30 years ago!

So, what is Trump Tower? It's a 58-story mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building contains offices, residences, a hotel, and retail stores. It's located on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets.

The tower was designed by Der Scutt of Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. Interestingly, the original design called for a glass facade, but this was changed because of concerns about reflections on nearby buildings.

Trump Tower has been used as the backdrop for many movies and TV shows over the years. For example, it was used in Season 5 of Homeland and The Mindy Project.

So why is Trump Tower so famous? It all comes down to Donald Trump! He made the tower famous by using it as his base of operations and by appearing on TV shows like The Apprentice from there.

#  Why Trump Tower isn't a new casino free slot machines – it's an office building!

Ever since Trump Tower was first announced, people have been wondering what it is. Well, it's an office building!

Despite appearances, Trump Tower is not a casino – it doesn't even have slot machines. The building was originally going to be a casino, but the plans were changed after Donald Trump decided to run for president.

Now, Trump Tower is home to some of the biggest names in business, including Microsoft, Alibaba, and Google. The tower is also the headquarters of the Trump Organization.

#  Casino-free Trump Tower: Office building instead of gambling destination

After a series of bankruptcies, Donald Trump turned his focus to the world of real estate. His first major project was Trump Tower, a 58-story skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building contains both residences and offices, with the latter being the main draw for tenants.

Interestingly, one of Trump's original intentions for the tower was to make it into a casino. However, after getting permits and working on the design, he eventually scrapped those plans and made it into an office building instead. It would have been one of the first major casinos in New York City, but thankfully it never came to be.

Nowadays, Trump Tower is one of the most famous office buildings in New York City. It's home to some of the world's biggest companies, including The Trump Organization, Starbucks, Gucci, and Tiffany & Co. Not only is it one of the most prestigious addresses in NYC, but it's also one of the most expensive. Rent at Trump Tower ranges from $70 per square foot to $100 per square foot.

Despite all the controversies surrounding Donald Trump lately, his namesake tower continues to be a desirable location for businesses and residents alike. And with no casino included, that's definitely a good thing!

#  The real reason why Trump Tower isn't a casino: it's an office building with no slots!

If you're like most people, when you think of Trump Tower, you probably think of a luxurious casino resort. After all, who wouldn't want to gamble in the same building as the President of the United States?

But as it turns out, Trump Tower is not a casino. It's actually an office building that just happens to have a really nice lobby. There are no slots or gaming tables in the building – it's strictly for business tenants.

So why doesn't Trump Tower have a casino? The answer is simple: because it's not allowed. New York State law prohibits any casino from being located within a certain distance of an educational institution. And since Columbia University is located nearby, Trump Tower can't be a casino.

It's also worth noting that Donald Trump himself has never been particularly interested in casinos. He's never owned one, and he's only ever been involved in a few deals to develop them. So even if Trump Tower were allowed to have a casino, it's unlikely that he would have been the one to build it.
